Educators and students are at the center of everything we do in the Fontana Teachers Association. Education happens wherever a student and teacher are working together; our business is making teachers respected and valued to support the success of that educational moment. Behind every successful student is a successful educator. We recognize that collectively we are stronger in our unified work of improving teaching conditions in the FUSD, because teaching conditions are learning conditions.

F.T.A. is the exclusive representative of the educators of the Fontana Unified School district, such as the teachers, counselors, and nurses working in the schools and district offices in all matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations including, but not limited to, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. We form a representative body capable of developing group opinion on professional matters to speak with authority for members. We promote cooperation and communication between education support professionals and certificated educators. We encourage cooperation and communication between the profession and the community and seek to foster good fellowship among members.
